# Stick Note App

I have created new web app that allows you tor create sticky notes. You can change position of sticky notes which have been created before by dragging them to their new position.

## What I have used so far?

* mui icons
* react-draggable
* css
* Redux(redux-toolkit)
* react-toastify
* React Hooks(useEffect,useState,useRef)
